What
==========================

>The rOpenGov is a community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government data and computational social sciences. 

>A community of independent package developers around open goverment data analytics is now emerging at rOpenGov. Independent projects dedicated to open data streams relevant to computational social sciences have already joined in, providing dedicated R tools to access and analyze these information sources. We are now setting up the project and its infrastructure, and actively encouraging new contributions.

Why
=========================

>The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking. A community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of the lessons learned in similar initiatives in other fields such as Bioconductor and rOpenSci.
